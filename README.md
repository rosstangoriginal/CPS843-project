This is a simple image classification project using TensorFlow. The project involves training a model to classify images of three different shoe brands: Adidas, Converse, and Nike.

## Requirements
- Python 3
- TensorFlow
- PIL (Python Imaging Library)

## Dataset
The dataset contains 711 images, which are divided into training and validation sets. The `train` folder contains 569 images for training, and the `test` folder contains 142 images for validation.

## Usage
1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Navigate to the project directory and install the required packages using `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
3. Run `python train.py` to train the model.
4. Run `python predict.py <image_path>` to classify a new image.

## Credits
The dataset used in this project was obtained from Kaggle.
